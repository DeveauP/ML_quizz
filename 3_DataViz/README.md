# Can you make the data talk?

We have a labelled dataset in dataset3.tsv. The labels are stored in "label" column, the rest are features.

We would like to plot the distribution of labels on a single plot.
1) What technic do you suggest to represent our data?
2) Given the plot, suggest a good algorithm to separate the two classes.
