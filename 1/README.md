The dataset dataset1 contains a tsv (tab separated value) file.

We would like to predict Y, knowing all other variables.

1) What are the features relevant to predict Y?
2) Explain what is over-fitting. Which features are you going to keep for your model?
3) What is the prediction of your model for the following points:
1. (3,0.8,-2,3,0.6,4,2,8) 
2. (4,0.3,2,-3,0.1,1,4,3)
